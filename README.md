#  Predicting Rwanda Crop Yield


In this project, I will be looking at using agricultural data from the [National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda](https://microdata.statistics.gov.rw/index.php/catalog) data repository to predict crop yield on different farms.  I believe one of the more powerful and useful applications of data science is within agriculture.  Not only does this infusion of analytics allow for more sustainable farming but also address key challenges such as food scarcity.  Particularly in developing countries, sustainable food production can also combat poverty and help foster political stability.  Being able to predict crop yield specifically helps farmers in numerous ways such risk management and efficiently allocating their resources (labor, equipment, seeds, etc).   This project has an inital summary write up (below) and then later on I will post more in-depth walk-throughs for the different sections.
