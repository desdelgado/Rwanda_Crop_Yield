    "In this project, I will be looking at using agricultureal data from the [National Institue of Statistics of Rwanda](https://microdata.statistics.gov.rw/index.php/catalog/88/get_microdata) data repository to predict crop yield in different areas.  I believe one of the most powerful and useful applications of data science is within agriculutre.  Not only does this allow for more sustainable farming which combats climate change but also address key challenges such as food scacity.  Particulary in developing countries, sustainable food production can combat poverty and lead to stablitiy within the country.  This is a summary write up of the end-to-end process.  Later on, I will had more detailed write ups of each seperate part.\n",

    "Again, I got this data digging around the [National Institue of Statistics of Rwanda](https://microdata.statistics.gov.rw/index.php/catalog/88/get_microdata) data repository.  Note you will need to fill out a few forms describing why you want the data.  If you click on the \"data description\" tab for 2017 in the [repository](https://microdata.statistics.gov.rw/index.php/catalog/88/data_dictionary), we see that we get a wide range of data from fertilizer to crop production to pesticides information.  We also see that the data is divided into three seasons(A,B,C) and small/large scale farms.  In this first attempt, we will be looking at crop production and fertilizer data from season A and only for large scale farms during 2017.  Crop production will have information about our target variable (yield) and after some reading, fertilizer also seems to play a crucial role.  In the later attempts, we can expand to other seasons, datasets, and farm types, but for now we are going to start small and try to extract immediate value.  Finally, once a general pipeline is created, going back and adding additional data should have less overhead.\n",

    "We'll first import all the important libraries.  These were added as they were needed during the project.  Note, there is a custom library `Aggro_DE` which is a toolkit I wrote to help process the data and reduce the amount of repeated code.  "

Some columns such as \"lsf_id\" will be dropped as they were just being used to merge data on.  The first step is to perform some exploritory data analysis to get a sense of what we are working with.  Right away if we plot our target variable in a histogram, we find that there are lots of zeros."
